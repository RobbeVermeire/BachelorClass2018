# Kapoor Scripts
These are the scripts we wrote for the Kapoor Project:

* [CameraShake.cs](https://github.com/RobbeVermeire/BachelorClass2018/tree/master/Projects/Main%20Projects/Kapoor/Scripts/CameraShake.cs)
This script is used to make the camera shake when an object impacts the ground. However this is not working for both Oculus GO and HTC Vive VR.

* [LevelChanger.cs](https://github.com/RobbeVermeire/BachelorClass2018/tree/master/Projects/Main%20Projects/Kapoor/Scripts/LevelChanger.cs)
Used to change from 1 unity scene to another.

* [FadeManager.cs](https://github.com/RobbeVermeire/BachelorClass2018/tree/master/Projects/Main%20Projects/Kapoor/Scripts/FadeManager.cs)
Used to fade the screen in and out.

* [FallingObject.cs](https://github.com/RobbeVermeire/BachelorClass2018/tree/master/Projects/Main%20Projects/Kapoor/Scripts/FallingObject.cs)
Used to make the object fall at the right time with the right gravity and speed.

* [SpinningObject.cs](https://github.com/RobbeVermeire/BachelorClass2018/tree/master/Projects/Main%20Projects/Kapoor/Scripts/SpinningObject.cs)
Used to make an object spin continuously.

* [MoveToCamera.cs](https://github.com/RobbeVermeire/BachelorClass2018/tree/master/Projects/Main%20Projects/Kapoor/Scripts/MoveToCamera.cs)
