# Kapoor
The project of the Kapoor group excists of two areas. One area is **virtually rendered in Unity3D** with 3D objects and the second area is a **360Â° mp4 clip** made in Adobe After effects.
With this we tried to give an accurate representation of the Artist **Anish Kapoor**. Kapoor uses alot of strange shapes and vivid colors in a very abstract way.


## Running the project
Because using github with Unity3D isn't really straight forward we couldn't upload the project in it's full to this github repo. However you can find this specific project along with the other 2 projects on one of the VR pc's of the VR Lab under **'C:\Users\VRLab\Documents\BachelorClass2018\...'** (this is subject to change). Now to run the project:
1. Navigate to **local projects** and go to the Kapoor project.
2. Open the **MainScene** file, this will open up Unity3D with the starting scene loaded.

You can now decide to build it for the HTC Vive or for the Oculus GO but there are still a few things you will need to do before you can run it.

For the **HTC Vive**, follow [this](https://github.com/RobbeVermeire/BachelorClass2018/blob/master/Documentation/Setting%20up/Setting%20up%20HTC%20VIVE%20dev%20environment.md) setup.

For the **Oculus GO** you will need to follow [this](https://github.com/RobbeVermeire/BachelorClass2018/blob/master/Documentation/Setting%20up/Setting%20up%20oculus%20GO%20dev%20environment.md) setup.


**Note:** The scripts we wrote for this project didn't cause any trouble so they are uploaded to this repo. You can find them [here](https://github.com/RobbeVermeire/BachelorClass2018/tree/master/Projects/Main%20Projects/Kapoor/Scripts).
