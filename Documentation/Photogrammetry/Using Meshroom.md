# Using Meshroom

Meshroom is a free, open-source 3D Reconstruction Software based on the AliceVision Photogrammetric Computer Vision framework. We can use it as a photogrammetry program for scanning objects in real life and digitise them. We can then use these digital scans of real life models in Unity for our scripts. We do this by taking pictures at different angles of our object, then putting it in Meshroom and let it process.

## Installing Meshroom

- Go over to their site and download the latest binary (Linux/Windows only):
https://alicevision.github.io/#meshroom  
- Unzip to preferred location
- Run Meshroom.exe!
  
## Using Meshroom

Meshroom is not difficult to use, it has an intuitive GUI and all you really have to do is drag & drop your photo's in & press on "start".

The 3D reconstruction of our object takes a long time and depends on how many images you have, the resolution of the images and many more factors I won't discuss here.
