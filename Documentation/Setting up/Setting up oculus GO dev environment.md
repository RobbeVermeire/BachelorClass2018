## Updating / Uninstalling an Oculus Go application
Uninstalling or updating your Oculus GO application isn't really straightforward. You will need to run the following command:
```
    adb uninstall 'package name'
```
Where 'package name' is the same as you entered previously: 'com.[company name].[project name]'. For example, 'com.ArtesisPlantyn.myapp'.
