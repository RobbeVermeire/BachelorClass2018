# Panamarenko Project  
## Panamarenko  
Panamarenko is a Belgian artist, his sculptures were themed around aeroplanes. He designed machines to make them look like they 
would be able to fly. Here's an example of his work:

## Script
We worked together with art students from Sint-Lukas for these projects, they came up with the scripts. For Panamarenko
they wanted to make you feel like you were inside his sketchbook. On startup you would be inside a square room with textures that 
resemble a square sketchbook's texture. The viewer looks around in the room while Panamarenko's voice is played. While the viewer
looks around the room sketches from Panamarenko apear on the walls. When all the sketches (around 10) have appeared the user will 
be able to erase the walls revealing a space-like space. Flying in the space are machines resembling Panamarenko's.
